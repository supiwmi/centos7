Reset your GitLab root password from a terminal
Start the console with this command:

 gitlab-rails console production
 u = User.where(id: 1).first
 u.password = 'secret_pass'
 u.password_confirmation = 'secret_pass'
 u.save!

The ( ! ) symbol is very important. 
Otherwise your changes are not pushed to the database. 
Now exit the console and try to login with your new password. 
It should work now.
